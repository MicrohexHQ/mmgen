To thwart dictionary attacks, it's recommended to use a strong hash preset

The transaction's outputs are specified on the command line, while its inputs
are chosen from a list of the user's unpent outputs via an interactive menu.

If the transaction fee is not specified on the command line (see FEE
SPECIFICATION below), it will be calculated dynamically using network fee
estimation for the default (or user-specified) number of confirmations.
If network fee estimation fails, the user will be prompted for a fee.

Network-estimated fees will be multiplied by the value of '--tx-fee-adj',
if specified.

Ages of transactions are approximate based on an average block discovery
interval of one per {g.proto.secs_per_block} seconds.

All addresses on the command line can be either {pnu} addresses or {pnm}
addresses of the form <seed ID>:<index>.

To send the value of all inputs (minus TX fee) to a single output, specify
one address with no amount on the command line.

Transactions may contain both {pnm} or non-{pnm} input addresses.

To sign non-{pnm} inputs, a {dn} wallet dump or flat key list is used
as the key source ('--keys-from-file' option).

To sign {pnm} inputs, key data is generated from a seed as with the
{pnl}-addrgen and {pnl}-keygen commands.  Alternatively, a key-address file
may be used (--mmgen-keys-from-file option).

Multiple wallets or other seed files can be listed on the command line in
any order.  If the seeds required to sign the transaction's inputs are not
found in these files (or in the default wallet), the user will be prompted
for seed data interactively.

To prevent an attacker from crafting transactions with bogus {pnm}-to-{pnu}
address mappings, all outputs to {pnm} addresses are verified with a seed
source.  Therefore, seed files or a key-address file for all {pnm} outputs
must also be supplied on the command line if the data can't be found in the
default wallet.

Seed source files must have the canonical extensions listed in the 'FileExt'
column below:
